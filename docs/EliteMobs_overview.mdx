# Overview

EliteMobs introduces a tier system that determines how strong an elite is and how often it appears. Higher tiers are rarer, stronger, and more rewarding.

## Tier Distribution

Global tier spawn chances are defined in `main.yml`:

```yaml
Spawning:
  spawnChancePerTier:
    - 0.46
    - 0.28
    - 0.16
    - 0.08
    - 0.04
```

You can override these per environment to create high-tier zones.

## Scaling

Health and damage are scaled per tier in `main.yml`:

```yaml
Health:
  healthMultiplierPerTier:
    - 0.1
    - 0.5
    - 1.1
    - 1.8
    - 2.6

Damage:
  mobDamageMultiplierPerTier:
    - 0.6
    - 1.1
    - 1.6
    - 2.1
    - 2.6
```

## Visual Identity

Elites use tiered nameplate prefixes and optional model scaling. The defaults are configured in `visuals.yml`.

## Loot And Gear

Elites can equip gear and drop rarer items. Gear catalogs and rarity rules are defined in `catalogs.yml`. Loot rules are in `drops.yml`.
