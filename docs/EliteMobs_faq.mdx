# FAQ

## Why did my YAML file change after editing?

EliteMobs reconciles configs on boot. Defaults are the source of truth, and missing keys are re-added automatically. Keep edits minimal and avoid deleting whole sections.

## How do I make elites rarer?

Lower the values in `Spawning.spawnChancePerTier` in `main.yml`, or disable specific environments in `environmentTierSpawns`.

## How do I disable elites in a specific zone?

Set `enabled: false` for that environment in `main.yml` under `environmentTierSpawns`.

## How do I change elite names?

Edit `visuals.yml` under `Nameplates.tierPrefixesByFamily` and `nameplatePrefixPerTier`.

## How do I stop a specific NPC from becoming elite?

Add or adjust a rule in `mobs.yml` using `matchExcludes`, or disable a specific rule with `enabled: false`.

## Where are templates stored?

Generated templates live under `Server/` in the EliteMobs mod folder.
