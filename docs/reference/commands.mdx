## Admin Commands

All commands require operator permissions by default.

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/rpgmobs reload` | Reloads all YAML configuration files from disk. Spawn logic updates immediately. Existing elites are reconciled based on `core.yml` reconcile settings. |
| `/rpgmobs spawn <role> <tier>` | Spawns an elite NPC with the specified role and tier at your location. Only available when debug mode is enabled. |
| `/npc clean --confirm` | Removes all Elite entities from the world. This is a destructive action and requires the `--confirm` flag. Useful for debugging or when uninstalling the mod. |

## Permissions

| Permission | What it allows |
| :--- | :--- |
| `rpgmobs.reload` | Use the `/rpgmobs reload` command. |
| `rpgmobs.spawn` | Use the `/rpgmobs spawn` command (debug mode only). |

Currently, all commands default to OP-only. A full permission node system for mod-compatible permission managers is planned for a future update.
