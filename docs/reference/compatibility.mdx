EliteMobs is designed to work alongside other Hytale mods with minimal configuration.

## NameplateBuilder

EliteMobs uses [NameplateBuilder](https://github.com/TimShol/hytale-nameplate-builder) for nameplate rendering. NameplateBuilder provides the tiered nameplate display, rank indicators, and family prefixes shown above elite mobs. It is included automatically and requires no additional setup.

If you are building a mod that displays custom nameplates alongside EliteMobs, refer to the NameplateBuilder documentation for integration details.

## EliteMobs API

Mod developers who want to react to elite events, query mob state, or modify loot and damage at runtime should use the `elitemobs-api` artifact. It ships as a lightweight compile-time dependency separate from the main plugin.

See the [API Overview](/api/overview) for setup instructions, event types, and query methods.

## Custom Item Mods

If you have a mod that adds new weapons or armor (e.g., `SpartanWeaponry_Longsword_Iron`), you need to add those item IDs to the `weaponCatalog` or `armorMaterials` lists in `gear.yml`. Otherwise, elites will never equip them.

You should also add keyword-to-rarity mappings in `weaponRarityRulesContains` and `armorRarityRulesContains` so the items are assigned the correct rarity tier.

## World Generation Mods

The `ENVIRONMENT` progression style relies on standard Hytale zone tags (e.g., `Env_Zone1`, `Env_Zone2`). If a custom world generation mod does not apply these tags, elites may fall back to the `default` tier distribution.

For the best compatibility with custom maps and world generation, use `progressionStyle: DISTANCE_FROM_SPAWN` in `spawning.yml`. This mode uses world coordinates instead of zone tags.
