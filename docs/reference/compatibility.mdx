RPGMobs is designed to work alongside other Hytale mods with minimal configuration.

## NameplateBuilder

RPGMobs uses [NameplateBuilder](https://github.com/TimShol/hytale-nameplate-builder) for nameplate rendering. NameplateBuilder provides the tiered nameplate display, rank indicators, and family prefixes shown above RPG Mobs. It is included automatically and requires no additional setup.

If you are building a mod that displays custom nameplates alongside RPGMobs, refer to the NameplateBuilder documentation for integration details.

## RPGMobs API

Mod developers who want to react to elite events, query mob state, or modify loot and damage at runtime should use the `RPGMobs-api` artifact. It ships as a lightweight compile-time dependency separate from the main plugin.

See the [API Overview](/api/overview) for setup instructions, event types, and query methods.

## RPGLeveling

RPGMobs has built-in support for [RPGLeveling](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/rpgleveling). When both mods are installed, elite kills grant tier-scaled XP and summoned minion kills grant reduced XP. The integration activates automatically when RPGLeveling is detected.

### XP Scaling

- **Tier multiplier**: XP from elite kills is multiplied by a per-tier value (default: 1× / 1.5× / 2× / 3× / 5× for Tiers 1–5)
- **Ability bonus**: Elites with active abilities (Charge Leap, Heal Potion, Undead Summon) grant bonus XP per ability
- **Minion reduction**: Summoned minion kills grant only 5% of the base XP to prevent XP farming

### Configuration

RPGMobs generates a standalone `rpgleveling.yml` in the mod config directory when RPGLeveling is detected:

```yaml
# XP multiplier per tier. Applied to the base XP determined by RPGLeveling.
# Example: Tier 3 with 2.0 means the player receives 2x the base XP.
XP:
  xpMultiplierPerTier:
    - 1.0
    - 1.5
    - 2.0
    - 3.0
    - 5.0

  # Bonus XP added for each active ability on the killed elite.
  xpBonusPerAbility: 1000.0

  # XP multiplier for summoned minion kills.
  # 0.05 = 5% of the base XP. Set to 0.0 to grant no XP for minions.
  minionXPMultiplier: 0.05
```

To enable or disable the integration, set `enabled` in `core.yml` under `Integrations.RPGLeveling`:

```yaml
Integrations:
  RPGLeveling:
    enabled: true
```

Set `enabled: false` to disable the integration entirely. The `rpgleveling.yml` file is only generated when RPGLeveling is present and the integration is enabled.

## Custom Item Mods

If you have a mod that adds new weapons or armor (e.g., `SpartanWeaponry_Longsword_Iron`), you need to add those item IDs to the `weaponCatalog` or `armorMaterials` lists in `gear.yml`. Otherwise, elites will never equip them.

You should also add keyword-to-rarity mappings in `weaponRarityRulesContains` and `armorRarityRulesContains` so the items are assigned the correct rarity tier.

## World Generation Mods

The `ENVIRONMENT` progression style relies on standard Hytale zone tags (e.g., `Env_Zone1`, `Env_Zone2`). If a custom world generation mod does not apply these tags, elites may fall back to the `default` tier distribution.

For the best compatibility with custom maps and world generation, use `progressionStyle: DISTANCE_FROM_SPAWN` in `spawning.yml`. This mode uses world coordinates instead of zone tags.
