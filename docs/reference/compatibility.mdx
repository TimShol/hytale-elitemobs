EliteMobs is designed to work alongside other Hytale mods with minimal configuration.

## RPG Leveling Mods

EliteMobs automatically detects popular leveling mods at startup. When detected, it can align its tier system with the external level system for consistent nameplate display. If a compatible bridge plugin (EliteMobsRPGLevelingCompat) is detected, the integration is seamless. Without the bridge, a warning is shown to players on join.

You can toggle these join messages with `showCompatJoinMessages` in `core.yml`.

## Custom Item Mods

If you have a mod that adds new weapons or armor (e.g., `SpartanWeaponry_Longsword_Iron`), you need to add those item IDs to the `weaponCatalog` or `armorMaterials` lists in `gear.yml`. Otherwise, elites will never equip them.

You should also add keyword-to-rarity mappings in `weaponRarityRulesContains` and `armorRarityRulesContains` so the items are assigned the correct rarity tier.

## World Generation Mods

The `ENVIRONMENT` progression style relies on standard Hytale zone tags (e.g., `Env_Zone1`, `Env_Zone2`). If a custom world generation mod does not apply these tags, elites may fall back to the `default` tier distribution.

For the best compatibility with custom maps and world generation, use `progressionStyle: DISTANCE_FROM_SPAWN` in `spawning.yml`. This mode uses world coordinates instead of zone tags.
