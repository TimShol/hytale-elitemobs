## Troubleshooting

### Why aren't elites spawning?
1.  Check `spawning.yml` -> `globalSpawnChance` (default is `0.15`, or 15%).
2.  If using `ENVIRONMENT` progression, make sure you are in a supported zone (Zone 1-4).
3.  Check `mobs.yml` to confirm the NPC type has a matching mob rule with `enabled: true`.
4.  Check server logs for YAML parsing errors on startup.

### Why are mobs one-shotting me?
Check `stats.yml` -> `mobDamageMultiplierPerTier`. The default Tier 5 multiplier is `2.6`. For vanilla Hytale without armor mods, you might want to lower it to `2.0` or less.

### Why do some mobs have abilities and others don't?
Abilities are gated by tier and mob type. By default, only Tier 4 and 5 elites can use abilities. Additionally, each ability has a `gate` that restricts it to specific mob families (e.g., Undead Summon only works on skeletons/zombies/wraiths, and Charge Leap is disabled for ranged mobs).

### How do I remove the mod safely?
1.  Run `/npc clean --confirm` to remove all existing Elite entities.
2.  Stop the server.
3.  Remove the JAR file from the `mods` folder.
4.  Restart the server.

If you skip step 1, you may have leftover entities with broken behavior until they are naturally killed or despawn.

## Configuration

### Can I make elites spawn everywhere?
Yes. Set `progressionStyle: NONE` in `spawning.yml`. This randomizes tiers regardless of location using the global `spawnChancePerTier` weights.

### How do I disable abilities entirely?
In `abilities.yml`, set `isEnabled: false` on each ability you want to disable. You can also disable abilities for specific tiers using the `isEnabledPerTier` array.

### How do I disable the particle effects?
Particle effects come from the status effects system in `effects.yml`. Set `isEnabled: false` on the `EFFECT_PROJECTILE_RESISTANCE` entry to disable both the effect and its particles.

### How do I add modded weapons to the loot pool?
Add the weapon's item ID to the `weaponCatalog` list in `gear.yml`, and add a keyword-to-rarity mapping in `weaponRarityRulesContains`. Then run `/RPGMobs reload`.

### Can I prevent elites from spawning in specific zones?
Yes. In `spawning.yml`, find the `environmentTierSpawns` entry for that zone and set `enabled: false`.
