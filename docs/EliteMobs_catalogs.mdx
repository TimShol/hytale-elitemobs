title: Gear Catalogs
description: Configure weapon and armor catalogs and rarity rules.
---

Catalogs are defined in `catalogs.yml` under `Gear`. They control which items elites can roll and how rarity is assigned.

## Armor Catalog

`armorMaterials` lists available armor material folders, and `armorPiecesToEquipPerTier` controls how many pieces elites equip by tier. Higher tiers equip more armor by default.

```yaml
Gear:
  armorPiecesToEquipPerTier: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## Weapon Catalog

`weaponCatalog` lists allowed weapon IDs. Elite gear selection pulls from this list when equipping weapons. Remove items here to blacklist them from elite spawns.

## Rarity Rules

Rarity is mapped by substring matching. First match wins. Use specific substrings first, and broad substrings last.

```yaml
Gear:
  weaponRarityRulesContains:
    copper: "common"
    iron: "uncommon"
    thorium: "rare"
    adamantite: "epic"
```

## Tier Rarity Weights

```yaml
Gear:
  tierAllowedRarities:
    - ["common"]
    - ["uncommon"]
    - ["rare"]
    - ["epic"]
    - ["epic", "legendary"]
```

If a rarity is not allowed for a tier, it can never be rolled.

## Utility Slot And Two-Handed Weapons

```yaml
Gear:
  shieldUtilityChancePerTier: [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6]
  twoHandedWeaponIds: ["shortbow", "crossbow", "spear", "staff", "battleaxe", "longsword", "bomb"]
```

Two-handed weapon ids prevent shield equips.
