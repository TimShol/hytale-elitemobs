# Gear Catalogs

Catalogs are defined in `catalogs.yml` under `Gear`.

## Armor Catalog

`armorMaterials` lists available armor material folders, and `armorPiecesToEquipPerTier` controls how many pieces elites equip by tier.

```yaml
Gear:
  armorPiecesToEquipPerTier:
    - 0
    - 1
    - 2
    - 3
    - 4
```

## Weapon Catalog

`weaponCatalog` lists allowed weapon IDs. EliteMobs selects from this list when equipping weapons.

## Rarity Rules

Rarity is mapped by substring matching. First match wins.

```yaml
Gear:
  weaponRarityRulesContains:
    copper: "common"
    iron: "uncommon"
    thorium: "rare"
    adamantite: "epic"
```

## Tier Rarity Weights

```yaml
Gear:
  tierAllowedRarities:
    - ["common"]
    - ["uncommon"]
    - ["rare"]
    - ["epic"]
    - ["epic", "legendary"]
```

These rules define which rarities are allowed for each tier and how likely each is to appear.
