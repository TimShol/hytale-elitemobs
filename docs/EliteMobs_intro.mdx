# Introduction

EliteMobs turns regular NPCs into tiered elite variants with boosted stats, distinctive nameplates, and optional abilities and effects. You control where elites spawn, how strong they are, what gear they can use, and what loot they drop through a small set of YAML config files.

## What You Can Configure

- Spawn chance per tier, globally or per environment
- Health and damage scaling per tier
- Abilities and effects with gating rules
- Tiered loot and gear catalogs
- Model scaling and nameplates

## Where Config Lives

All config files live under your save folder:

```
%APPDATA%\Hytale\UserData\Saves\<save name>\mods\EliteMobs
```

## File Layout

- `main.yml` global systems, spawning, scaling, compatibility
- `mobs.yml` per-NPC matching rules and weapon overrides
- `abilities.yml` abilities and gating rules
- `effects.yml` tiered effects
- `drops.yml` loot rules and extra drops
- `catalogs.yml` armor and weapon catalogs with rarity rules
- `consumables.yml` consumable timing and slowdowns
- `visuals.yml` model scaling and nameplates

## Notes About Auto-Generated Configs

These YAML files are auto-generated and reconciled on boot. Defaults are the source of truth, and missing keys are re-added automatically. Keep edits minimal and avoid deleting entire sections.
