# Administration

## Requirements

EliteMobs was built for Hytale Update 2.

## Installation

1. Download the EliteMobs `.jar`.
2. Place it in your server `mods` folder.
3. Start the server to generate configuration files.

## Works On Existing Worlds

EliteMobs was built to work on existing worlds without a reset.

## Config Location

```
%APPDATA%\Hytale\UserData\Saves\<save name>\mods\EliteMobs
```

## Runtime Reload

```text
/elitemobs reload
```

Reloads the YAML configuration without restarting the server. Changes that affect already-spawned mobs or generated assets may require a restart to fully apply.

## Uninstalling

If you remove the mod, leftover elite NPCs can remain with modified stats and equipment. Do not kill them directly because it can crash the game. Use:

```text
/npc clean --confirm
```

Repeat until all remaining elite NPCs are removed.
