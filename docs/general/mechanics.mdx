## The Tier System

EliteMobs classifies enemies into 5 tiers of power. These tiers determine an entity's health, damage output, equipment quality, and ability access.

| Tier | Name | Indicator | Challenge Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Common | `[•]` | Baseline challenge, slightly stronger than vanilla. |
| **2** | Uncommon | `[• •]` | Noticeable threat, better equipped. |
| **3** | Rare | `[• • •]` | Dangerous, requires decent gear to fight. |
| **4** | Epic | `[• • • •]` | Mini-boss difficulty, can use combat abilities. |
| **5** | Legendary | `[• • • • •]` | Boss-level threat, best loot, maximum size, full ability access. |

## Progression Styles

The mod decides *where* high-tier mobs spawn based on the `progressionStyle` setting in `spawning.yml`.

### 1. Environment (Default)
Tiers are tied to Hytale's zone difficulty.
*   **Zone 1 (Emerald Grove):** Mostly Tier 1-2, no Tier 4-5.
*   **Zone 2 (Howling Sands):** Mix of Tier 1-3, rare Tier 4.
*   **Zone 3 (Borea):** Tier 2-5, no Tier 1.
*   **Zone 4 (Devastated Lands):** Tier 3-5 only, the hardest content.

### 2. Distance from Spawn
Difficulty scales linearly as you travel further from coordinates `(0,0)`.
*   **Near Spawn:** Safe, mostly vanilla or Tier 1.
*   **Deep Wilderness:** Tiers gradually increase every ~1000 blocks (configurable).
*   **Bonus Stats:** Mobs gain small health/damage bonuses every ~100 blocks between tier jumps, creating a smooth difficulty curve.

### 3. None (Random)
Any tier can spawn anywhere based on global weights. Good for hardcore survival servers or arena maps.

## Combat Mechanics

### Abilities
Elites aren't just stat sponges. Depending on their tier and type, they can:
*   **Charge Leap:** Launch themselves at a player with a physics-based slam attack.
*   **Heal:** Drink potions during combat. Players can interrupt the heal by dealing damage.
*   **Summon:** Call reinforcement minions (e.g., Skeleton Archers) to overwhelm players.

Abilities are only available to Tier 4 and 5 elites by default. See [Abilities](/config/abilities) for full configuration.

### Scaling
*   **Health:** Multiplied per tier (e.g., Tier 5 has +260% base health).
*   **Damage:** Multiplied per tier (e.g., Tier 5 deals 2.6x damage).
*   **Size:** Higher tiers are physically larger (up to +18% scale).

See [Stats](/config/stats) for tuning these values.

## Equipment

Elites spawn with tier-appropriate gear. Higher tiers get rarer weapons and more armor pieces. A Tier 1 common goblin might have a crude wooden weapon, while a Tier 5 legendary skeleton could wield an adamantite longsword with full armor.

See [Gear](/config/gear) for equipment catalogs and rarity rules.

## Loot System

Elites drop vanilla loot with multipliers (e.g., 6x drops from Tier 5) and have a chance to drop their equipped gear. Custom drop tables add crafting materials, potions, and gems that scale with tier difficulty.

See [Loot](/config/loot) for drop rates and custom drop tables.
