# Mob Rules

Mob rules are configured in `mobs.yml` under `Spawning.rules`. The first matching rule wins.

## Rule Matching

Each rule can match by:
- Exact NPC ids
- Prefixes
- Substrings
- Exclusions

Example:

```yaml
Goblin_Duke:
  enabled: true
  matchExact: ["Goblin_Duke"]
  matchStartsWith: []
  matchContains: []
  matchExcludes: []
```

## Weapon Overrides

Weapon overrides are optional and can be gated by tier and weapon ids.

```yaml
Goblin_Duke:
  enableWeaponOverrideForTier: [true, true, true, true, true]
  weaponOverrideMode: ALWAYS
  weaponIdMustContain: ["club"]
```

`weaponOverrideMode` supports modes like `ALWAYS`, `ONLY_IF_EMPTY`, or `NONE`.

## Tips

- Use `matchExact` when possible for precision.
- Use `matchContains` to cover multiple variants.
- Keep overrides aligned with `catalogs.yml` so the weapon list stays valid.
