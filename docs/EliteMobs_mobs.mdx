title: Mob Rules
description: Control which NPCs become elites and how weapons are overridden.
---

Mob rules are configured in `mobs.yml` under `Spawning.rules`. The first matching rule wins.
If a mob does not match any rule, it will not be transformed into an elite.

## Rule Matching

Each rule can match by:
- Exact NPC ids
- Prefixes
- Substrings
- Exclusions

Example:

```yaml
Goblin_Duke:
  enabled: true
  matchExact: ["Goblin_Duke"]
  matchStartsWith: []
  matchContains: []
  matchExcludes: []
```

## Weapon Overrides

Weapon overrides are optional and can be gated by tier and weapon ids.
This is useful for forcing themed weapon sets per mob.

```yaml
Goblin_Duke:
  enableWeaponOverrideForTier: [true, true, true, true, true]
  weaponOverrideMode: ALWAYS
  weaponIdMustContain: ["club"]
```

`weaponOverrideMode` supports:
- `ALWAYS` replace the weapon
- `ONLY_IF_EMPTY` only if the NPC has no weapon
- `NONE` disable overrides
Override toggles per tier allow gradual scaling of loadouts.

## Tips

- Use `matchExact` when possible for precision.
- Use `matchContains` to cover multiple variants.
- Keep overrides aligned with `catalogs.yml` so the weapon list stays valid.
