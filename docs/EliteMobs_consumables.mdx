title: Consumables
description: Configure elite consumable use time and movement slowdown.
---

Consumable tuning is in `consumables.yml` under `Consumables.byId`.
These settings affect how long elites spend consuming and how much they slow down.

## Fields

- `horizontalSpeedMultiplier` slows movement while consuming
- `consumeDuration` controls how long the consume takes
Lower values increase risk during combat.

Example:

```yaml
Consumables:
  byId:
    food_tier1:
      horizontalSpeedMultiplier: 0.7
      consumeDuration: 1.0
    big_potions:
      horizontalSpeedMultiplier: 0.7
      consumeDuration: 1.8
```
