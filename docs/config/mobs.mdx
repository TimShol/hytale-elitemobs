title: Mobs
description: Defining per-mob rules for equipment and elite eligibility.
---

`mobs.yml` lets you define specific rules for individual NPC types. This is where you control which mobs can become elites, what weapons they should use, and how they are matched by the system.

## How Mob Rules Work

When a hostile NPC spawns, EliteMobs checks it against the mob rules list. The first matching rule wins. If no rule matches, the mob is **not** transformed into an elite.

Rules are matched using a scoring system:
- **Exact match** (highest priority) -- the mob's role ID matches a value in `matchExact`.
- **Prefix match** -- the role ID starts with a value in `matchStartsWith`.
- **Contains match** -- the role ID contains a value in `matchContains`.
- **Exclusions** -- if the role ID contains any value in `matchExcludes`, the rule is skipped.

## Example Rules

```yaml
Mobs:
  rules:
    Goblin_Miner:
      enabled: true
      matchExact: ["Goblin_Miner"]
      enableWeaponOverrideForTier: [true, true, true, true, true]
      weaponOverrideMode: ALWAYS
      weaponIdMustContain: ["pickaxe"]
      weaponIdMustNotContain: []

    Trork_Shaman:
      enabled: true
      matchExact: ["Trork_Shaman"]
      weaponOverrideMode: ALWAYS
      weaponIdMustContain: ["staff"]

    Goblin_Lobber:
      enabled: true
      matchExact: ["Goblin_Lobber"]
      enableWeaponOverrideForTier: [false, false, false, false, false]
      weaponOverrideMode: ONLY_IF_EMPTY
```

## Weapon Override Modes

| Mode | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ALWAYS` | Replaces the mob's weapon with one matching the criteria, regardless of what it was holding. |
| `ONLY_IF_EMPTY` | Only equips a weapon if the mob's hands are empty. |
| `NONE` | Never changes the mob's equipment. Use this for custom bosses or unarmed mobs. |

## Weapon Filtering

Use `weaponIdMustContain` and `weaponIdMustNotContain` to restrict what weapons a mob can be given.

- `weaponIdMustContain: ["pickaxe"]` -- the mob will only receive weapons whose ID contains "pickaxe".
- `weaponIdMustNotContain: ["shortbow", "crossbow"]` -- the mob will never receive ranged weapons.

## Per-Tier Enable

The `enableWeaponOverrideForTier` array lets you toggle weapon overrides per tier. Set a tier to `false` to let the mob keep its default weapon at that tier level.

```yaml
enableWeaponOverrideForTier: [true, true, true, true, true]
```

**Tip:** The default configuration includes rules for all standard Hytale hostile NPCs. If you add custom NPCs from another mod, add a matching rule here so they can become elites.
