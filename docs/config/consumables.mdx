description: Configuring potion and food behavior for elite mobs.
---

`consumables.yml` defines how items consumed by elites behave during combat. This mainly affects the **Heal Potion** ability, controlling how fast elites drink and how much it slows them down.

## Potion Behavior

When an elite drinks a potion, it slows down and plays a drinking animation. These settings control the timing and movement penalty.

```yaml
Consumables:
  byId:
    EliteMobs_Consumable_Big_Potions:
      horizontalSpeedMultiplier: 0.7
      consumeDuration: 1.8

    EliteMobs_Consumable_Small_Potions:
      horizontalSpeedMultiplier: 0.7
      consumeDuration: 1.2
```

| Setting | What it does | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `horizontalSpeedMultiplier` | Movement speed while consuming. `0.7` means the mob moves at 70% speed (30% slower). Lower values make it easier for players to close distance during the animation. | `0.7` |
| `consumeDuration` | Time in seconds to finish consuming the item. Longer durations give players more time to interrupt the heal. | `1.8` (big) / `1.2` (small) |

## Food Tiers

The default configuration also includes entries for food items used internally:

```yaml
Consumables:
  byId:
    EliteMobs_Consumable_Food_Tier1:
      horizontalSpeedMultiplier: 0.7
      consumeDuration: 1.0

    EliteMobs_Consumable_Food_Tier2:
      horizontalSpeedMultiplier: 0.7
      consumeDuration: 1.2

    EliteMobs_Consumable_Food_Tier3:
      horizontalSpeedMultiplier: 0.7
      consumeDuration: 1.4
```

**Tip:** If heals feel too easy for elites to complete, increase `consumeDuration` to give players a longer interrupt window. If elites are too easy to kite while drinking, raise `horizontalSpeedMultiplier` closer to `1.0`.
