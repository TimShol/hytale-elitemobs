title: Core Settings
description: Global system settings for diagnostics, reconciliation, and compatibility.
---

`core.yml` contains the global system settings that control how EliteMobs behaves behind the scenes. This includes debug logging, config reload behavior, and compatibility with other mods.

## Config Version

```yaml
System:
  configVersion: "1.1.0"
```

This is managed automatically by the mod. Do not edit this value. It is used internally to detect when configuration files need to be migrated after an update.

## Reconcile

When you reload the configuration with `/elitemobs reload`, existing elites in the world need to be updated to match the new settings. The reconcile system handles this.

```yaml
Reconcile:
  reconcileWindowTicks: 40
  announceReconcile: true
```

| Setting | What it does | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `reconcileWindowTicks` | Number of game ticks to spend updating existing elites after a reload. Set to `0` to skip reconciliation entirely (existing elites keep their old stats until they despawn). | `40` |
| `announceReconcile` | Logs a message in the server console when reconciliation starts and finishes. | `true` |

## Debug

```yaml
Debug:
  isDebugModeEnabled: true
  debugMobRuleScanIntervalSeconds: 5
```

| Setting | What it does | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `isDebugModeEnabled` | Enables detailed logging for spawn scans, ability decisions, and damage events. Turn this off in production to reduce log noise. | `true` |
| `debugMobRuleScanIntervalSeconds` | How often (in seconds) the debug logger reports mob rule scan statistics. | `5` |

## Compatibility

```yaml
Compat:
  showCompatJoinMessages: true
```

When a player joins the server, EliteMobs can display a message if it detects compatible mods (like RPG Leveling). Set this to `false` to silence those messages.
