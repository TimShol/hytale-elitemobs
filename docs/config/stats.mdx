description: Tuning health and damage scaling for each Elite tier.
---

`stats.yml` controls the core combat numbers. This is where you adjust how much health elites have and how hard they hit.

## Health Scaling

Each tier has a health multiplier that is added to the mob's base health. A value of `1.0` means the mob gets +100% health (double its normal amount).

```yaml
Health:
  enableHealthScaling: true
  healthMultiplierPerTier:
    - 0.1   # Tier 1 — 10% of base health
    - 0.5   # Tier 2 — 50% of base health
    - 1.1   # Tier 3 — 110% of base health
    - 1.8   # Tier 4 — 180% of base health
    - 2.6   # Tier 5 — 260% of base health
```

Set `enableHealthScaling` to `false` to give all elites their normal vanilla health regardless of tier.

**Tip:** If Tier 1 elites feel too similar to regular mobs, raise the first value to `0.3`. If Tier 5 elites are too spongy, lower the last value.

## Damage Scaling

Controls how much damage elites deal relative to their base attack.

```yaml
Damage:
  enableMobDamageMultiplier: true
  mobDamageMultiplierPerTier:
    - 0.6   # Tier 1 — 60% of base damage (weaker than vanilla)
    - 1.1   # Tier 2 — 110% of base damage
    - 1.6   # Tier 3 — 160% of base damage
    - 2.1   # Tier 4 — 210% of base damage
    - 2.6   # Tier 5 — 260% of base damage
  mobDamageRandomVariance: 0.05
```

| Setting | What it does | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `enableMobDamageMultiplier` | Toggle damage scaling on or off. | `true` |
| `mobDamageMultiplierPerTier` | Damage multiplier for each tier. Values below `1.0` make mobs weaker than vanilla. | See above |
| `mobDamageRandomVariance` | Adds a random offset to each hit. `0.05` means damage varies by +/-5%, so combat feels less predictable. | `0.05` |

**Tip:** If players are getting one-shot by Tier 5 mobs, lower the last damage value to `2.0`. If Tier 1 feels too easy, raise the first value above `1.0`.
