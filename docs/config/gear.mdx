description: Managing what equipment elites can wear and how it is assigned.
---

`gear.yml` defines the pool of weapons and armor that elites can equip, how item rarity is determined, and the rules for each tier's equipment quality.

## Durability

Gear spawned on elites is never at full condition. This makes dropped equipment feel like a used battlefield pickup rather than a brand-new item.

```yaml
Gear:
  spawnGearDurabilityMin: 0.02
  spawnGearDurabilityMax: 0.30
```

| Setting | What it does | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `spawnGearDurabilityMin` | Minimum durability fraction. `0.02` means gear can spawn at as low as 2% condition. | `0.02` |
| `spawnGearDurabilityMax` | Maximum durability fraction. `0.30` means gear spawns at most at 30% condition. | `0.30` |

## Two-Handed Weapons

Weapons in this list are treated as two-handed. Mobs holding a two-handed weapon will never equip a shield in their off-hand.

```yaml
Gear:
  twoHandedWeaponIds:
    - "shortbow"
    - "crossbow"
    - "spear"
    - "staff"
    - "battleaxe"
    - "longsword"
    - "bomb"
```

If a weapon ID contains any of these strings, it counts as two-handed. Add your own modded weapon keywords here if needed.

## Rarity Rules

EliteMobs determines an item's rarity by checking its ID against keyword rules. The first matching keyword wins.

```yaml
Gear:
  weaponRarityRulesContains:
    "wood": "common"
    "copper": "common"
    "iron": "uncommon"
    "steel": "uncommon"
    "thorium": "rare"
    "cobalt": "rare"
    "adamantite": "epic"
    "void": "epic"
    "flame": "legendary"
```

Armor uses the same system with `armorRarityRulesContains`.

## Tier Equipment Quality

Each tier has restrictions on what rarity of equipment it can use, and weighted chances for picking a rarity.

```yaml
Gear:
  tierAllowedRarities:
    - ["common"]               # Tier 1
    - ["uncommon"]             # Tier 2
    - ["rare"]                 # Tier 3
    - ["epic"]                 # Tier 4
    - ["epic", "legendary"]    # Tier 5

  tierEquipmentRarityWeights:
    - { "common": 1.0 }                       # Tier 1
    - { "uncommon": 1.0 }                     # Tier 2
    - { "rare": 0.70, "uncommon": 0.30 }      # Tier 3
    - { "epic": 0.70, "rare": 0.30 }          # Tier 4
    - { "legendary": 0.40, "epic": 0.60 }     # Tier 5
```

## Armor Slots

Controls how many armor pieces each tier equips and the chance of getting an off-hand utility item.

```yaml
Gear:
  armorPiecesToEquipPerTier:
    - 0  # Tier 1 — no armor
    - 1  # Tier 2 — one piece
    - 2  # Tier 3
    - 3  # Tier 4
    - 4  # Tier 5 — fully armored

  shieldUtilityChancePerTier:
    - 0.0   # Tier 1
    - 0.0   # Tier 2
    - 0.20  # Tier 3 — 20% chance of a shield
    - 0.40  # Tier 4 — 40% chance
    - 0.60  # Tier 5 — 60% chance
```

## Equipment Lists

The `weaponCatalog` and `armorMaterials` lists are the item pools that elites draw from. If you add new weapons or armor from another mod, add their IDs here so elites can equip them.

```yaml
Gear:
  weaponCatalog:
    - "Weapon_Sword_Iron"
    - "Weapon_Axe_Cobalt"
    - "Weapon_Staff_Bone"
    # ... full list in the generated config file

  armorMaterials:
    - "Iron"
    - "Cobalt"
    - "Adamantite"
    # ... full list in the generated config file
```

The default lists include all standard Hytale weapons and armor materials. The full lists are written to the generated config file on first run.
