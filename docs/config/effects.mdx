description: Configuring passive status effects applied to elites.

`effects.yml` controls the passive status effects that are applied to elites. These are ongoing buffs that affect gameplay and have visible particle effects.

## Projectile Resistance

This effect reduces the damage elites take from ranged attacks (bows, crossbows, staffs). It encourages players to engage high-tier elites in melee combat rather than kiting them from a distance.

```yaml
Effects:
  byId:
    EFFECT_PROJECTILE_RESISTANCE:
      isEnabled: true
      isEnabledPerTier: [false, false, false, true, true]
      amountMultiplierPerTier: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.85]
      infinite: true
```

| Setting | What it does | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `isEnabled` | Master toggle for this effect. Disabling it removes both the mechanic and the particle visuals. | `true` |
| `isEnabledPerTier` | Toggle per tier. By default, only Tier 4 and 5 have projectile resistance. | `[false, false, false, true, true]` |
| `amountMultiplierPerTier` | The resistance percentage for each tier. `0.7` means 70% of projectile damage is blocked. `0.85` means 85%. | `[0, 0, 0, 0.7, 0.85]` |
| `infinite` | Whether the effect lasts forever or has a limited duration. | `true` |

**Tip:** If you find the particle effects visually overwhelming, set `isEnabled` to `false`. If you want ranged builds to remain viable against high-tier elites, lower the resistance values (e.g., `0.3` and `0.5`).
