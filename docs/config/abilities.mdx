description: Configuring the special combat abilities that elites can use.
---

`abilities.yml` defines the special combat abilities that make elites more than just stat-boosted mobs. Each ability has its own activation rules, cooldowns, and per-tier scaling.

## Common Fields

Every ability shares these settings:

| Field | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `isEnabled` | Master toggle for the ability. |
| `isEnabledPerTier` | Toggle per tier. For example, `[false, false, false, true, true]` means only Tier 4-5 elites can use this ability. |
| `chancePerTier` | Probability that an elite of each tier gets this ability when it spawns. `1.0` = guaranteed. |
| `cooldownSecondsPerTier` | Minimum time between uses for each tier. |
| `gate` | Restrictions on which mobs can use this ability based on role name or weapon type. |

### Ability Gating

Gates prevent certain mobs from using abilities that don't make sense for them.

```yaml
gate:
  roleMustContain: []
  roleMustNotContain: ["Eye_Void", "Crawler_Void"]
  weaponIdMustContain: []
  weaponIdMustNotContain: ["shortbow", "crossbow", "staff"]
```

For example, the Charge Leap gate excludes ranged mobs (they shouldn't leap) and specific void creatures.

## Charge Leap

A physics-based attack where the elite launches itself at a nearby player, dealing slam damage on impact.

```yaml
charge_leap:
  isEnabled: true
  isEnabledPerTier: [false, false, false, true, true]
  cooldownSecondsPerTier: [0, 0, 0, 16, 20]
  minRange: 9.0
  maxRange: 30.0
  faceTarget: true
  slamBaseDamagePerTier: [0, 0, 0, 20, 30]
  applyForcePerTier: [0, 0, 0, 530, 530]
  slamRangePerTier: [0, 0, 0, 3, 4]
  knockbackLiftPerTier: [0, 0, 0, 3, 6]
  knockbackPushAwayPerTier: [0, 0, 0, -3, -6]
  knockbackForcePerTier: [0, 0, 0, 20, 26]
```

| Setting | What it does                                                          |
| :--- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `minRange` / `maxRange` | The elite will only leap if the target is within this distance range. |
| `faceTarget` | Whether the mob turns to face the player before leaping.              |
| `slamBaseDamagePerTier` | Flat damage dealt on impact for each tier.                            |
| `applyForcePerTier` | Launch velocity force. Higher values mean faster, longer leaps.       |
| `slamRangePerTier` | Area-of-effect radius for the slam damage.                            |
| `knockbackLiftPerTier` | Upward knockback applied to nearby players on landing.                |
| `knockbackPushAwayPerTier` | Horizontal knockback (positive values pull inward).                            |
| `knockbackForcePerTier` | Overall knockback strength.                                           |

## Heal Potion

Allows the elite to drink a healing potion when its health drops below a threshold. Players can interrupt the heal by dealing enough hits during the drinking animation.

```yaml
heal_potion:
  isEnabled: true
  isEnabledPerTier: [false, false, false, true, true]
  cooldownSecondsPerTier: [0, 0, 0, 15, 15]
  minHealthTriggerPercent: 0.50
  maxHealthTriggerPercent: 0.50
  instantHealChance: 1.0
  instantHealAmountPerTier: [0, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25]
  npcDrinkDurationSeconds: 3.0
  npcDrinkItemId: "Potion_Health_Greater"
```

| Setting | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `minHealthTriggerPercent` / `maxHealthTriggerPercent` | The health threshold range at which the heal triggers. A random value between min and max is chosen once when the elite spawns. `0.50` means the elite tries to heal at 50% HP. |
| `instantHealChance` | Chance to use an instant heal (restores health immediately) vs. regeneration over time. `1.0` = always instant. |
| `instantHealAmountPerTier` | Fraction of max health restored by instant heal. `0.25` = heals 25% of max HP. |
| `npcDrinkDurationSeconds` | How long the drinking animation lasts. Players have this window to interrupt it. |
| `npcDrinkItemId` | The item the mob visually holds while drinking. |

## Undead Summon

Allows undead type elites to summon reinforcement minions (skeleton archers, zombies, wraiths) during combat. When the summoner dies, all its minions despawn.

```yaml
undead_summon:
  isEnabled: true
  isEnabledPerTier: [false, false, false, false, true]
  chancePerTier: [0, 0, 0, 1.0, 1.0]
  cooldownSecondsPerTier: [0, 0, 0, 15, 15]
  maxAlive: 7
  skeletonArcherWeight: 100
  zombieWeight: 8
  wraithWeight: 3
  roleIdentifiers:
    - "Skeleton_Frost"
    - "Skeleton_Sand"
    - "Skeleton_Burnt"
    - "Skeleton"
```

| Setting | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `maxAlive` | Maximum number of summoned minions alive at once per summoner. Capped at 0-50. |
| `skeletonArcherWeight` | Weight for skeleton archers in the summon pool. Higher = more likely. |
| `zombieWeight` | Weight for zombie minions. |
| `wraithWeight` | Weight for wraith minions. |
| `roleIdentifiers` | List of role name fragments used to pick which variant of minion gets summoned. The summoner's own role is checked against this list to pick a matching variant. |

**Tip:** The summon ability is gated to undead mobs by default (`roleMustContain: ["skeleton_", "zombie_", "wraith"]`). If you want other mob types to summon, modify the gate settings.
