description: Customizing nameplates, model scaling, and asset generation.

`visuals.yml` controls how elites look in the world. This includes their overhead nameplates, physical size, and the internal asset generation system.

## Nameplates

Nameplates are the overhead text labels that help players identify an elite's tier at a glance.

```yaml
Nameplates:
  nameplatesEnabled: true
  nameplateMode: RANKED_ROLE
  nameplatePrefixPerTier:
    - "[•]"
    - "[• •]"
    - "[• • •]"
    - "[• • • •]"
    - "[• • • • •]"
```

| Setting | What it does | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `nameplatesEnabled` | Master toggle for all elite nameplates. | `true` |
| `nameplateMode` | `RANKED_ROLE` shows the tier prefix and a themed name (e.g., "[• •] Rotting Zombie"). `SIMPLE` shows just the tier prefix. | `RANKED_ROLE` |
| `nameplatePrefixPerTier` | The visual indicator prepended to the mob's name for each tier. | See above |
| `nameplatesEnabledPerTier` | Toggle nameplates per tier individually. | All `true` |

### Nameplate Filtering

You can control which mobs get nameplates using include/exclude lists.

```yaml
Nameplates:
  nameplateMustContainRoles: []
  nameplateMustNotContainRoles: []
```

Leave `nameplateMustContainRoles` empty to allow all mobs. Add role name fragments to restrict nameplates to specific mob types. Use `nameplateMustNotContainRoles` to exclude specific mobs.

### Family Prefixes

Elites get themed name prefixes based on their mob family. A zombie might be called "Rotting" at Tier 1 and "Evolved" at Tier 5, while a skeleton could be "Broken" at Tier 1 and "Ascendant" at Tier 5.

```yaml
Nameplates:
  tierPrefixesByFamily:
    zombie: ["Rotting", "Ravenous", "Putrid", "Monstrous", "Evolved"]
    skeleton: ["Broken", "Reforged", "Grim", "Deathbound", "Ascendant"]
    goblin: ["Sneaky", "Cutthroat", "Brutal", "Overseer", "Overlord"]
    void: ["Faded", "Shaded", "Umbral", "Abyssal", "Voidborn"]
    default: ["Common", "Uncommon", "Rare", "Epic", "Legendary"]
```

Each list must have exactly 5 entries (one per tier). The `default` entry is used for mob families not explicitly listed. You can add or customize families to match your server's theme.

## Model Scaling

Makes higher-tier mobs physically larger so players can judge threat level by size.

```yaml
Model:
  enableModelScaling: true
  modelScaleMultiplierPerTier:
    - 0.74  # Tier 1 — slightly smaller than normal
    - 0.85  # Tier 2
    - 0.96  # Tier 3 — near vanilla size
    - 1.07  # Tier 4 — slightly larger
    - 1.18  # Tier 5 — 18% larger than normal
  modelScaleRandomVariance: 0.04
```

| Setting | What it does | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `enableModelScaling` | Toggle size scaling on or off. | `true` |
| `modelScaleMultiplierPerTier` | Scale multiplier per tier. `1.0` is vanilla size. | See above |
| `modelScaleRandomVariance` | Random size offset to prevent identical-looking elites. `0.04` means +/-4%. | `0.04` |

## Asset Generation

Internal settings for the tiered asset file generation system. You generally do not need to change these.

```yaml
AssetGenerator:
  tierSuffixes: ["Tier_1", "Tier_2", "Tier_3", "Tier_4", "Tier_5"]
```

These suffixes are appended to template asset filenames when generating per-tier variants.
