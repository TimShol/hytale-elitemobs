description: Configuring what rewards players get for defeating elites.

`loot.yml` controls the drops and rewards that elites leave behind when defeated. This includes their equipped gear, vanilla loot multipliers, and custom drop tables.

## Equipment Drops

Elites have a chance to drop the gear they are wearing. Each slot rolls independently.

```yaml
Loot:
  dropWeaponChance: 0.05
  dropArmorPieceChance: 0.05
  dropOffhandItemChance: 0.05
```

| Setting | What it does | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `dropWeaponChance` | Chance for the elite to drop its main-hand weapon. | `0.05` (5%) |
| `dropArmorPieceChance` | Chance for each armor piece to drop individually. | `0.05` (5%) |
| `dropOffhandItemChance` | Chance for the off-hand item (shield, torch) to drop. | `0.05` (5%) |

**Tip:** If you want equipment drops to feel special and rare, keep these low. If you want a more generous loot experience, raise them to `0.15` or higher.

## Vanilla Loot Multiplier

Higher-tier elites drop more of their standard loot (bones, rotten flesh, etc.).

```yaml
Loot:
  vanillaDroplistMultiplierPerTier:
    - 0  # Tier 1 — normal vanilla drops
    - 0  # Tier 2 — normal vanilla drops
    - 2  # Tier 3 — 2x vanilla drops
    - 4  # Tier 4 — 4x vanilla drops
    - 6  # Tier 5 — 6x vanilla drops
```

A value of `0` means the mob drops its normal vanilla amount. A value of `4` means it drops 4 times the normal amount.

## Extra Drops

Custom items that only drop from specific tier ranges. This is where you add crafting materials, potions, gems, and other rewards.

```yaml
Loot:
  extraDrops:
    - itemId: "Ingredient_Life_Essence"
      chance: 1.0
      minTierInclusive: 3
      maxTierInclusive: 4
      minQty: 11
      maxQty: 21

    - itemId: "Ore_Mithril"
      chance: 0.15
      minTierInclusive: 4
      maxTierInclusive: 4
      minQty: 1
      maxQty: 5

    - itemId: "Rock_Gem_Diamond"
      chance: 0.02
      minTierInclusive: 4
      maxTierInclusive: 4
      minQty: 1
      maxQty: 1
```

| Field | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `itemId` | The Hytale item identifier to drop. |
| `chance` | Drop probability from `0.0` (never) to `1.0` (always). |
| `minTierInclusive` | Lowest tier that can drop this item (0-4). |
| `maxTierInclusive` | Highest tier that can drop this item (0-4). |
| `minQty` | Minimum stack size when dropped. |
| `maxQty` | Maximum stack size when dropped. |

The default configuration includes a progression of crafting materials: copper and iron ores from early tiers, cobalt and thorium from mid tiers, and mithril, onyxium, adamantite, gems, and potions from the highest tiers.
