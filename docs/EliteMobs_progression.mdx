# Progression

EliteMobs was built with progression driven by tier distribution, stat scaling, and loot quality. Server owners can tune the curve to match their desired difficulty.

## Tier Curve

- **Tier 1**: Common elites with modest buffs.
- **Tier 2–3**: Mid-tier elites with clear stat scaling.
- **Tier 4–5**: High-tier elites with stronger scaling and more abilities enabled.

## Environment Progression

Per-environment tier overrides let you create:
- Early zones with low-tier elites
- Mid zones with mixed tiers
- Endgame zones skewed toward Tier 4 and 5

See [Spawning](/EliteMobs_spawning) for environment-based tier rules.

## Loot Curve

Loot tables scale with tier and can multiply vanilla drops per tier. See [Drops](/EliteMobs_drops).
