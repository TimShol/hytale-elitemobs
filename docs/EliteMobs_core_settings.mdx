title: Core Settings (main.yml)
description: Global settings for spawning, scaling, reconcile, debug, gear durability, and asset generation.
---

EliteMobs was built with global systems defined in `main.yml`. These settings affect how elites spawn, scale, and reconcile after reloads.

## System

```yaml
System:
  configVersion: "1.1.0"
```

This is auto-managed. You should not edit it.

## Reconcile

Reconcile updates existing elites after a config reload.

```yaml
Reconcile:
  announceReconcile: true
  reconcileWindowTicks: 40
```

- `reconcileWindowTicks`: ticks to re-apply features to existing elites after reload. `0` disables.
- `announceReconcile`: logs when reconcile starts and ends.

## Debug

```yaml
Debug:
  isDebugModeEnabled: true
  debugMobRuleScanIntervalSeconds: 5
```

Enables extra logs for spawn scans and ability decisions. The scan interval controls how often NPCs are evaluated against mob rules.

## Spawning

See [Spawning](/EliteMobs_spawning) for full details.

## Health & Damage Scaling

```yaml
Health:
  enableHealthScaling: true
  healthMultiplierPerTier: [0.1, 0.5, 1.1, 1.8, 2.6]

Damage:
  enableMobDamageMultiplier: true
  mobDamageMultiplierPerTier: [0.6, 1.1, 1.6, 2.1, 2.6]
  mobDamageRandomVariance: 0.05
```

`mobDamageRandomVariance` adds random variance to the damage multiplier to avoid uniform hits.

## Compatibility Messages

```yaml
Compat:
  showCompatJoinMessages: true
```

Shows compatibility messages when players join, useful for identifying active integrations.

## Gear Durability

```yaml
Gear:
  spawnGearDurabilityMin: 0.02
  spawnGearDurabilityMax: 0.30
```

Newly spawned elite gear rolls durability between these fractions of max durability.

## Asset Generator

```yaml
AssetGenerator:
  tierSuffixes: ["Tier_1", "Tier_2", "Tier_3", "Tier_4", "Tier_5"]
```

Tier suffixes control how tiered assets are generated under `Server/`.
