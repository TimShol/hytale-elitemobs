title: Spawning
description: Configure where elites spawn and how tier chances are distributed.
---

Spawning rules are defined in `main.yml` under `Spawning`. These settings control where elites appear and how tier probability is distributed.

## Base Tier Chances

Each value is a weight, not a percentage. Higher values make that tier more likely.

```yaml
Spawning:
  spawnChancePerTier:
    - 0.46
    - 0.28
    - 0.16
    - 0.08
    - 0.04
```

## Per-Environment Overrides

Enable environment overrides and specify per-environment tier weights:

```yaml
Spawning:
  enableEnvironmentTierSpawns: true
  environmentTierSpawns:
    default:
      enabled: true
      spawnChancePerTier: [0.46, 0.28, 0.16, 0.08, 0.04]
    Env_Zone1:
      enabled: true
      spawnChancePerTier: [0.6, 0.25, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0]
```

- If an environment is not listed, base `spawnChancePerTier` applies.
- If `enabled: false`, elites never spawn in that environment.
Use environment overrides to shape progression across zones without changing the global balance.

## Reconcile Window

After a config reload, existing elites can be reconciled within a window of ticks. See [Core Settings](/EliteMobs_core_settings).
