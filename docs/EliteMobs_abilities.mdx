description: Configure elite abilities, activation rules, and per-tier tuning.
---

Abilities are defined in `abilities.yml` under `byId`.
Each ability is rolled once on spawn per tier using `chancePerTier`.

## Common Fields

- `gate` rules based on NPC role or weapon
- `minRange` and `maxRange` for activation
- `chancePerTier` for per-tier activation chances (rolled once on spawn)
- `cooldownSecondsPerTier` for per-tier cooldowns
- `isEnabledPerTier` to toggle specific tiers

## Ability Gates

Ability gates can filter by:
- `roleMustContain` / `roleMustNotContain`
- `weaponIdMustContain` / `weaponIdMustNotContain`
- `rules` for layered allow/deny logic
Use gates to limit abilities to specific factions or weapon types.

## Charge Leap

Charge leap is a tiered leap that slams and deals damage on impact.
It is enabled for higher tiers by default.

Key fields:
- `slamRangePerTier`
- `slamBaseDamagePerTier`
- `applyForcePerTier`
- `knockbackLiftPerTier`, `knockbackPushAwayPerTier`, `knockbackForcePerTier`

## Heal Potion

Heals trigger when health falls between configured thresholds.
The heal can be instant or a breakable potion effect.

Key fields:
- `minHealthTriggerPercent` and `maxHealthTriggerPercent`
- `instantHealChance` and `instantHealAmountPerTier`
- `npcDrinkDurationSeconds` and `npcDrinkItemId`

## Undead Summon

Summons undead minions using weighted pools.
Summons are capped by `maxAlive` to prevent runaway fights.

Key fields:
- `roleIdentifiers` to select the summon archetype
- `maxAlive` to limit active minions per summoner
- `skeletonArcherWeight`, `zombieWeight`, `wraithWeight`
- `spawnMarkerEntries` for advanced explicit spawn markers

### Advanced Spawn Marker Entry

```yaml
spawnMarkerEntries:
  - Name: "Skeleton_Archer"
    Weight: 100
    Flock: "EliteMobs_Summon_3_7"
    SpawnAfterGameTime: "PT0S"
```

`SpawnAfterGameTime` uses ISO-8601 duration format (e.g. `PT1S`).
