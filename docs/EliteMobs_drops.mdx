# Drops

Loot rules are configured in `drops.yml` under `Loot`.

## Base Drop Chances

```yaml
Loot:
  dropArmorPieceChance: 0.05
  dropOffhandItemChance: 0.05
  dropWeaponChance: 0.05
```

## Extra Drops

Extra drops are tier-bounded and can be tuned per item:

```yaml
Loot:
  extraDrops:
    - itemId: "Ingredient_Life_Essence"
      chance: 1.0
      minTierInclusive: 3
      maxTierInclusive: 4
      minQty: 11
      maxQty: 21
```

## Tips

- Use narrower tier ranges for high-value items.
- Keep higher tier loot rare to preserve progression.
