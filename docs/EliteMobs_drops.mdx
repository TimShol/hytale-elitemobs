description: Configure elite loot, vanilla multipliers, and extra drops.
---

Loot rules are configured in `drops.yml` under `Loot`.
Drops are rolled on elite death and can include equipped items and extra tables.

## Base Drop Chances

```yaml
Loot:
  dropArmorPieceChance: 0.05
  dropOffhandItemChance: 0.05
  dropWeaponChance: 0.05
```

These chances control the drop of equipped items.
Each equipped piece is rolled independently.

## Vanilla Drop Multipliers

```yaml
Loot:
  vanillaDroplistMultiplierPerTier: [0, 0, 2, 4, 6]
```

This multiplies vanilla resource drops by tier.
Lower tiers can be set to `0` to avoid extra resource drops.

## Extra Drops

Extra drops are tier-bounded and can be tuned per item:
These rolls are additive and do not replace normal drops.

```yaml
Loot:
  extraDrops:
    - itemId: "Ingredient_Life_Essence"
      chance: 1.0
      minTierInclusive: 3
      maxTierInclusive: 4
      minQty: 11
      maxQty: 21
```

## Tips

- Use narrower tier ranges for high-value items.
- Keep higher tier loot rare to preserve progression.
