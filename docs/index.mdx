description: Introduction to EliteMobs for Hytale.
---

**EliteMobs** transforms the Hytale PvE experience by introducing a tiered elite system to standard NPCs. It bridges the gap between casual exploration and hardcore RPG progression, offering configurable challenges, rewards, and visual variety.

## Features at a Glance

*   **Tiered Difficulty:** 5 distinct power tiers (Common to Legendary) with scaling health and damage.
*   **Dynamic Spawning:** Elites spawn naturally in the world based on zone difficulty or distance from spawn.
*   **Combat Abilities:** Unique mechanics like Charge Leaps, Healing Potions, and Undead Summoning.
*   **RPG Itemization:** Loot system with rarity-weighted equipment and custom drop tables.
*   **Visual Flair:** Rank-specific nameplates, size scaling, and particle effects.
*   **Developer API:** Event-driven API with 12 event types, a read-only query interface, and cancellable hooks for other mods to integrate with.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install:** Place the mod JAR in your server's `mods` folder.
2.  **Run:** Start the server once to generate the default configuration files in `%APPDATA%\Hytale\UserData\Saves\<save>\mods\EliteMobs`.
3.  **Configure:** Adjust `spawning.yml` to set your preferred progression style (Zone-based or Distance-based).
4.  **Play:** Explore the world. You will encounter Elite enemies distinguished by their nameplates and size.
