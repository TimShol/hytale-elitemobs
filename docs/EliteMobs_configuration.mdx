# Configuration Map

EliteMobs uses a small set of YAML files. Defaults are in code, and YAML overrides are applied on boot. Missing keys are re-added automatically.

## Core Files

- `main.yml` global systems, spawning, scaling, compatibility, and gear durability
- `mobs.yml` NPC matching rules and weapon override rules
- `abilities.yml` abilities, gates, and per-tier tuning
- `effects.yml` status effects and per-tier enables
- `drops.yml` base drop chances and extra drop tables
- `catalogs.yml` weapon and armor catalogs plus rarity rules
- `consumables.yml` consumable use times and movement slowdown
- `visuals.yml` model scaling and nameplate rules

## Conventions

- Arrays with 5 values map to Tier 1 through Tier 5.
- Per-environment overrides are supported in `main.yml`.
- Most sections include `enabled` or `isEnabled` toggles.

## Safe Editing

- Avoid deleting sections. Remove or toggle specific values instead.
- Keep backups or use git for version control.
