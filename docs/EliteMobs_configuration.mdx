# Configuration Map

EliteMobs was built to be configured through a small set of YAML files. Defaults are in code and YAML overrides are applied on boot. Missing keys are re-added automatically.

## Core Files

- `main.yml` global systems, spawning, scaling, compatibility, gear durability, and asset generation
- `mobs.yml` NPC matching rules and weapon override rules
- `abilities.yml` abilities, gates, and per-tier tuning
- `effects.yml` status effects and per-tier enables
- `drops.yml` base drop chances, vanilla drop multipliers, and extra drop tables
- `catalogs.yml` weapon and armor catalogs plus rarity rules
- `consumables.yml` consumable use times and movement slowdown
- `visuals.yml` model scaling and nameplate rules

## Where To Start

- For difficulty: `main.yml` (health, damage, tier chances)
- For identity: `visuals.yml` (nameplates, scaling)
- For rewards: `drops.yml` and `catalogs.yml`
- For behavior: `abilities.yml` and `mobs.yml`

## Conventions

- Arrays with 5 values map to Tier 1 through Tier 5.
- Per-environment overrides are supported in `main.yml`.
- Most sections include `enabled` or `isEnabled` toggles.
